/**
 * Package-visible class consolidating common code for
 * <code>MemoryCacheImageInputStream</code> and
 * <code>MemoryCacheImageOutputStream</code>.
 * This class keeps an <code>ArrayList</code> of 8K blocks,
 * loaded sequentially.  Blocks may only be disposed of
 * from the index 0 forward.  As blocks are freed, the
 * corresponding entries in the array list are set to
 * <code>null</code>, but no compacting is performed.
 * This allows the index for each block to never change,
 * and the length of the cache is always the same as the
 * total amount of data ever cached.  Cached data is
 * therefore always contiguous from the point of last
 * disposal to the current length.
 *
 * <p> The total number of blocks resident in the cache must not
 * exceed <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>.  In practice, the limit of
 * available memory will be exceeded long before this becomes an
 * issue, since a full cache would contain 8192*2^31 = 16 terabytes of
 * data.
 *
 * A <code>MemoryCache</code> may be reused after a call
 * to <code>reset()</code>.
